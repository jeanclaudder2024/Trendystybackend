# 🔧 Trendysty Connection & Deployment Fix Guide

## 🚨 Issues Found & Solutions

### 1. **Missing Environment Variables**
**Problem**: Your Website and Dashboard were using default localhost URLs instead of your Netlify backend.

**✅ FIXED**: Created proper `.env` files with correct API URLs.

### 2. **Incorrect API URLs**
**Problem**: Frontend apps couldn't connect to your deployed backend.

**✅ FIXED**: Updated `.env` files with proper Netlify backend URL structure.

## 🔗 **Step 1: Get Your Actual Backend URL**

You need to find your actual Netlify backend URL. Here's how:

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**: https://app.netlify.com
2. **Find your Backend site** (should be named something like `trendysty-backend` or similar)
3. **Copy the site URL** (it will look like: `https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app`)

## 🛠️ **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**

### **For Website** (`d:\michel-deib-project\Trendysty\Website\.env`):
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://YOUR-ACTUAL-BACKEND-URL.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/server/api
```

### **For Dashboard** (`d:\michel-deib-project\Trendysty\Dashboard\.env`):
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://YOUR-ACTUAL-BACKEND-URL.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/server/api
```

**Replace `YOUR-ACTUAL-BACKEND-URL` with your real Netlify backend URL!**

## 🚀 **Step 3: Deploy/Redeploy Your Applications**

### **Option A: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**
1. Commit and push your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix API connection URLs"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Netlify will automatically redeploy your sites.

### **Option B: Manual Deployment**
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. For each site (Website & Dashboard):
   - Click on the site
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

## 🔍 **Step 4: Set Environment Variables in Netlify**

For **Website** and **Dashboard** sites in Netlify:

1. Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. Add this variable:
   - **Key**: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://YOUR-ACTUAL-BACKEND-URL.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/server/api`

---

## 🧪 **Step 5: Test Your Connections**

### **Test Backend**:
Visit: `https://YOUR-BACKEND-URL.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/server`
Should show: `{"message": "Trendysty Backend API is running!"}`

### **Test Website**:
1. Visit your website URL
2. Check browser console (F12) for any API errors
3. Try browsing products

### **Test Dashboard**:
1. Visit your dashboard URL
2. Try logging in with:
   - **Email**: `admin@trendysty.com`
   - **Password**: `admin123`
